## Summary and Motivation
\[Insert a summary here. It should be no more than one paragraph, but communicate the general idea of the proposal. Then, with another paragraph, explain the reasoning for why this is needed.]
## Design
\[Describe, in detail, how the end user will interact with this. Include specific details, like how to perform certain tasks or general ideas of layout.]
## Implementation
\[Describe, in detail, how this will be implemented on a code level. Don't write any actual code, but outline the code that needs to be written for this to work.]
## Drawbacks and Alternate Designs
\[Explain the ways in which this might not be the best way to perform the task described in the Motivation paragraph. Cite specific examples of how other projects perform this task, and describe why despite that this is still the best way to go about accomplishing this task. Be sure that if any other work is used, to specifically cite it!]
